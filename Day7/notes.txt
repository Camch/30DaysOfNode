NPM = Node Package Manager
It's the package manager for node.js applications.
It helps you install, update, remove and publish packages.
Node.js is the largest ecosystem of open source online libraries.

NPM is installed along with node.js

Update: npm install @latest -g
    Check version: npm -v

**package.json**
1. manages the locally installed packages
2. serves as a documentation on which our project depends
3. Like a directory which keeps track of all the 
dependencies our project is using.
4. We can specify the versions of packages we're using in our project.

**Create package.json**
> npm init
> npm init --yes

If we're having a package.json file in our project, then we can install all our dependencies using just:
> npm install command.
It will not install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json

** Installing packages via NPM ** 
1. Locally:
We install packages locally when we need to require them in our application. Then syntax for downloading a package locally is 
> npm install <package_name>
i.e > npm install grannit
    This command will create node_modules folder in your pwd
    and download the package in that directory.
TEST: We can check if >npm install 
worked by manually check whether the directory with the
name if node_modules exists or not.
And, if node_modules directory exists, does it contain
a directory for the package we installed.

2.Globally:
We install packages globally when we want to use it as
a command line tool or run in the background for example forever
, grunt-cli. The syntax for global download of packages is 
> npm install -g <package_name>.
i.e: > npm install -g forever

** Install specific version of a package **
Exact verison:
> npm install express@4.15.1 
=============================
NOT-exact version
> npm install express@^4.0.0

** Updating a package **
1. Updating local packages:
> npm update
Run this command in the same folder as package.json file
TEST:
> npm outdated
if there is no output after this, it means that all packages are updated

2. Updating global packages:
> npm install -g forever

3. Find global outdated packages:
>npm outdated -g --depth=0

It will output a table containing:
    package: contains the name of the package
    current: the current version of the package installed
    wanted: specifies the maximum version of the package as mentioned in the package.json that satisfies semver
            it shows the current installed version if we don't have semver
    latest: specifies latest available global -g or the package is not included in package.json
    location: specifies the location of the installed package

 == Update all outdated packages (Global) ==
 > npm update -gl

 *** Removing a Packge ***
 1. Removing local packages
    >npm uninstall gannit
ALSO removing the package.json
    >npm install --save grannit
IF we have installed devDepencendy
    >npm uninstall --save-dev gannit

2. Removing for global packages:
    >npm uninstall -g forever
