error.code : This is a string label which is used to identify the type of error. It specifies errors in the form of node.js error codes

error.stack : It returns a string in which details are provided about where in the code the eror was instantiated.

Error.captureStackTrace : This is usede to create a .stack property on the target object which returns the location in the code where Error.captureStackTrace() was called. It returns the data in the form of string.
 
Error.stackTraceLimit : This property specifies number of stack frames captured by stack trace. It can be any valid JS number however 10 is the default value. If set to a non-number or negative, then stack trace will not return any frames.

========================

1. Synchronous API: These are those APIs which is blocking method that does not accept callback function and uses <throw> to report errors

2. Asynchronous API: Errors which occurs in asynchronous APIs can be reported in multiple ways as shown below:
    - Error can be routed to the object's <error> event if an asynchronous event is called on an object.

connection.on('error') => {
    //This is the error event which is used to handle the error properly
    console.error(err);
}

* Asynchronous methods in node.js accept an error object passed as the first argument given that method should accept callbacks. These errors are handled in the following way:
*see async-file

========================

About Errors:

1. Standard JavaScript errors:
* <URI> error: global URI handling function is misused.
* <Eval> error: call to eval() fails.
* <Type> error: subclass of error which shows that the argument is not of allowed type.
* <Range> error: argument was not accepted in Range
* <Syntax> error: not valid JavaScript
* <Reference> error: access to non-existing variable

2. System error:
* error.code: represents and error code,
* error.port: unavailable connection's ports
* error.address: represents address to connection failed
* error.path: invalid path-name
* error.syscall: failed syscall
* error.errno: like error.code but for numbers instead

3. User-specified errors:
* generated by application code

4. Assertion errors: raised by assert, occurs when an exceptional logic violation is detected in node.js that should never occur.
