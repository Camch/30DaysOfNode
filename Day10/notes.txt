Encryption: deals with providing confidentiality to the
data so that only authorize personnel have access to the data.
In encryption, plain text is transformed to an
unintelligible text with the help of <key> and <algorithm> which
we can read but cannot understand due to which confidentiality of the data
is protected.
This unintelligible text is known as Cipher text.

Decryption: process of rendering the data, so that it
can be changed into a human or machine readable and
understandable form. It takes the cipher text as input
and converts it into plain text with help of
<key> and <algorithm>.

Two ways to perform:
Symmetric/private key: the same key is used when encrypting and decrypting
            It's fast.

Asymmetric/public key: using a pair of keys to perform encryption and decryption.
The key of encrypting is not the same as the key of decrypting
The key pair can be generated by openSSL or any other
key generator.
Public key is known to all, but the private key is only known to
the person whom it belongs to.
