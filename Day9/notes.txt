crypto in node.js is used to provide cryptographic functionalities
It includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC. verify, cipher. deciper and sign funcitons.

*** What is hasing? ***
Hashing is a process of generating a fixed length of value from a string using mathmematical functions.
It is used for providing security.
Every hash generated using hashing is:
- Unique: In hashing, for every unique input -> unique output
          we will always get the same output for the same input data.
          Slightly change of the input will change the output to a large extent.

- Fixed length: hashing algorithms always generate the has with the same length.
                The length of input does not affect the length of the output.

- Irreversible: Generated hashes are irreversible in nature. We can not change the hash to the input text again.
